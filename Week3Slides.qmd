## Admin

-   Second Homework is posted; due Friday at midnight
-   Grades for Homework 1 posted in Canvas
-   Covering formatting today, enforced from now onwards
-   Office hours for homework questions

## Before we begin

-   Please create a [Github](https://github.com) account
-   Please make sure you have `git` installed (and optionally `github`
    CLI) 
-   [**HappyGitWithR**](https://happygitwithr.com) has a detailed guide

## What we'll cover

-   Creating a Quarto project in RStudio
-   Writing a modular document
-   Tracking changes with version control software (git)
-   Collaborating via a remote source (GitHub)

## Creating a Quarto Project

## Quarto

-   [Quarto formatting cheat
    sheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/quarto.pdf)
-   [Markdown
    Instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)
-   [Hadley on Quarto](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html#yaml-header)

## RStudio Projects

-   RStudio projects gives you an organization framework
-   Supports the 'git' idea - one project, one repository (directory)
-   Easy integration with GitHub (later)
-   `.Rproj` file specifies some project settings
-   Can either make new projects in new directories, or associate a
    directory with a project

## Git

-   Git is a *version control system* - lets you track progress over
    time

-   GitHub is a website that integrates with git to serve as a *remote
    repository source*

```{bash, echo=TRUE}
git --version
```

## Git

![](git_xkcd.png){fig-align="center"}

## Git

-   Git is wildly powerful, we do not need all the features it offers
-   Requires some configuration (esp. for GitHub)

```{bash, echo = TRUE}
git config --global user.name "Isaac Ray"
git config --global user.email "null@stat.tamu.edu"
```

## A few useful commands

```{bash, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Show all files in current working directory
ls -a
# Move to a folder in the current directory
cd name_of_subdirectory
# Move to the default home folder
cd ~
# Move to the parent folder of the current directory
cd ..
```

terminal/bash](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/02-the-filesystem/index.html)

## Git

-   One project, one repository (a directory)
-   To create a new repository from scratch, move to the desired
    location and type

```{bash, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
git init repository_name
```

-   Try it now using 'PracticeRepo' as the name
-   Enter the new folder (`cd PracticeRepo`) and look inside (`ls -a`)
-   Enter `git status` to ensure the repository was initialized
    successfully

## Git and RStudio Projects

-   When you create an RStudio Project, you have the option to
    initialize it as a Git repository
-   For a project in an existing directory, it will pick up if it is a
    Git repository
    -   `File -> New Project -> Existing Directory`
-   The **Git** tab should appear next to **Environment** (top right
    hand corner)
    -   If not, try restarting RStudio or go to
        `Tools -> Global/Project Options -> Git/SVN` and enable

## Git and RStudio Projects

-   Projects will always come with two files, a `.gitignore` and a
    `.RProj`
-   `.gitignore` files let you specify certain files that Git
    **shouldn't track**
    -   Git is best for plain text; poor for rich formats like PDF
-   In Git tab, it will show *changed files* (as compared to the blank
    folder)
-   Git works on the basis of *commits*

## Using Git for Fun and Profit

[Git Cheat
Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

Basic Workflow:

1.  **Pull** the version of the repository from the remote source via
    `git pull`
2.  **Stage** changes via `git add`
3.  **Commit** changes via `git commit -m "What this commit does"`
4.  **Push** changes to the remote source via `git push`

## Git Diagram

![](git_diagram.png){fig-align="center"}

## Git Best Practices

-   Don't nest version controlled repositories! One project, one
    repository, one `.RProj`, one `.gitignore`
-   Make *meaningful commits*
    -   Avoid committing massive chunks at once; break it up into
        logical units
    -   Commit logical changes together (unrelated changes go in
        different commits)
    -   Only commit complete changes, don't commit half-way
    -   **Write useful messages**!
-   A commit message should finish the sentence: "If applied, this
    commit will *commit message here"*
    -   If applied, this commit will *update the documentation for
        function abc*
    -   If applied, this commit will *fix a bug*

## Git Remote Sources

-   We will use GitHub as a *remote source* for our repositories
-   Serves as a way of collaborating, cloud backup for files, sharing
    results, etc.
-   You've been using it implicitly via
    `quarto use template rayisaacalan/homework-template`

[GitHub's own introductory
course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)

## Using Remote Sources

-   The remote source is considered the current 'true' version of the
    repository
-   'Pushing' to the remote source means your committed changes will
    become 'true'
-   'Pulling' from the remote source means your local version will
    update what it thinks is 'true'
-   What if these conflict?
-   Easier to avoid writing conflicts if you use
    [includes](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html)

## Using Remote Sources

To set up a remote source for your repository (for branch `main`):

```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
git remote add origin url_to_your_github_repo
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

Afterwards, you can `git push origin main` or `git pull origin main`. Be
sure to pull/push your changes *frequently*

## GitHub Repositories

-   Repositories can be public or private; up to you
-   Public repositories can be cloned or forked
    -   A fork is a copy of someone else's repository that you can fully
        control
    -   Useful for *branch-based development*, beyond the scope of this
        course
-   If you have a public repository, be sure to add a license

## Using GitHub within RStudio Project

-   Demo; within the Git tab you will have push/pull options as well as
    the ability to change remote sources
-   Easier in the CLI in my opinion, but the GUI option does the same
    things
-   Visual commits with highlighting is a nice feature, easy to stage
    changes

## Organizing Simulations with Git

-   Recommendation: One function, one file
-   Requirement: One purpose, one folder
    -   R functions for data generation, method implementation, metrics
        (**Functions** folder)
    -   R scripts to run the simulations (**Simulations** folder);
        **Output** and **Figures** subfolders for raw output and
        tables/visuals respectively
    -   R scripts for real data analysis (**Analysis** folder)
    -   Folder for raw data (.csv's, binaries, etc.) (**Data** folder)
-   Optional: **Source** for non-R functions (C, C++, etc), **Testing**
    for temporary files, etc

## Organization & Reproducibility

-   The code in your GitHub repository should be *clean, readable,
    documented,* and **reproducible**
-   If I clone your GitHub repo, open your main .qmd file, and click
    `Render` :
    -   I should not get any error messages (don't just suppress
        everything with `error=FALSE`)
    -   I should get **exactly** the same output that you do, up to
        numerical precision
    -   I should not be required to change any *file paths*
    -   I should be able to read and intuit the purpose of each file

## Reproducibility problems

You need to use *relative paths* when working within an RStudio project
(really, you always should!)

```{r bad_example_paths, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Wrong! myCoolFunction is not defined yet
model_output = myCoolFunction(data)
# Wrong! Absolute paths will not work on other machines
source("C:/Users/MyName/Documents/STAT489/Project/Functions/Methods.R")
model_output = myCoolFunction(data)
# Wrong! Incorrect relative path, should be 
# wrt top level repo
source("Methods.R")
model_output = myCoolFunction(data)
```

## Reproducibility problems

Relative paths are with respect to the top level directory; the folder
your `.Rproj` and `.gitignore` are in.

```{r good_example_paths, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
source("Functions/Methods.R")
model_output = myCoolFunction(data)
```

## Reproducibility problems

You should not mix *definitions* with *invocations* in your code;
function definitions should be ***side-effect free*** when sourced

```{r bad_example_source, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
myCoolFunction = function(X) {
  return(doneStuffWithX(X))
}
set.seed(07734)
random_variable = myCoolFunction(1337)
```

The only effects of sourcing a function file should be that function's
definition appearing in the environment

```{r good_example_source, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# contains nothing but def. of myCoolFunction
source("Functions/Methods.R") 
set.seed(07734)
random_variable = myCoolFunction(1337)
```

## Reproducibility problems

Tables and figures should be generated *automatically* in a script, not
manually through the GUI

![](manual_plot_save.png){fig-align="center"}

## Reproducibility problems

Instead, save automatically:

```{r good_example_plot, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# For base R plotting:
png(filename = "Simulations/Figures/meaningful_name.png")
plot(myAwesomeModel)
dev.off()
# For ggplot:
my_cool_ggplot = ggplot(some_data)
ggsave(filename = "Simulations/Figures/meaningful_name.png",
       plot = my_cool_ggplot)
```

## Other problems

-   Comment your code! You will forget what things do, it is for your
    own benefit too

-   Comments should be *meaningful*. Don't repeat verbatim, explain the
    intent

-   Ensure your variable names are purposeful. Don't call everything `x`
    and `y`

    ```{r example_comments, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
    # Bad comment:
    # applies myCoolFunction to y
    x = myCoolFunction(y) 
    # Good comment:
    # Creates a dataframe containing out-of-sample 
    # observations to pass to the metric functions 
    # for model validation
    test_covariates = createTestSplit(full_covariates)
    ```

## Literature Review

-   It is essential during research to understand what has come before

-   In-class: create Zotero groups
-   Next week: Journal expectations
-   Zotero can export `.bib` files that you can track using Git

## Looking forward:

Over the next few weeks we will discuss some models in context for your
projects:

-   Linear Models / Generalized Linear Models
-   Geographically weighted regression
-   Splines
-   Gaussian Processes
-   Random Forest / XGBoost
-   Simple neural networks

## Looking forward:

Since all groups selected spatial style problems, I recommend the
following book as a reference manual:

[Handbook of Spatial Statistics](https://doi.org/10.1201/9781420072884);
Gelfand, A.E., Diggle, P., Guttorp, P., & Fuentes, M. (Eds.). (2010).
CRC Press.

This goes far more in depth into many different subjects than we will be
able to cover

## Looking forward:

-   More sources of good data:

    -   <https://www.cdc.gov/places/index.html>
    -   <https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdrdatas_landing.html>
-   Optionally: combine results across groups; up to you
